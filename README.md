# SUPERSTORE-SALES-ANALYSIS
Project Title: Superstore Sales Prediction and Model Evaluation Project Description: This project involves analyzing and predicting sales data for a retail superstore using machine learning models. The objective is to build and evaluate multiple regression models to predict sales based on various features like quantity, discount, and profit.
Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: The data has been cleaned and processed for analysis, ensuring that missing values are handled, and relevant features are selected.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis and visualization of key trends, relationships, and outliers in the sales data.

Model Training & Evaluation: Three regression models—Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor—are used to predict sales.

Metrics: Performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² are computed to evaluate and compare model performance.

Visualization: Graphical representations of model performance and error distributions, allowing for easy interpretation of results.

Technologies Used:
Python: Primary language for data analysis and model development.

Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.

NumPy: Numerical operations for mathematical calculations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization to create charts and graphs.

Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development environment used for coding, testing, and documenting the project.
